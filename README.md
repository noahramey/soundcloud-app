# _Soundcloud Randomizer_

##### This application is a site to help me practice creating gulp tasks, bower tasks, and an API call via the Soundcloud API. The user can listen to a randomly loaded track on Soundcloud, skip the song, and log into Soundcloud and like the song.

## Technologies Used

Application: Node, Bower, JSON, NPM, Gulp<br>
Framework: Skeleton
